This section of the project proudly did not make use of any libraries!
(half of this was because of issues which occurred with the YahooFinance API Library, but it gave the opportunity to learn how to parse web data)


The code to retrieve fundemental data is derived from Nathan Hefner's work on https://github.com/natehefner.

S&P500 data is obtained from http://data.okfn.org/data/core/s-and-p-500-companies.
